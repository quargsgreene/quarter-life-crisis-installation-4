I’ve felt older than the oldest tree
Ever since I hit around fifteen
Despite the other people’s pleas
To enjoy my youth and live carefree
Living with my parents,I’m a two-time grad school reject Working more than one part-time job that pays not a cent more than peanuts Too many postings,I’ve applied,wanna cry,get a life Don’t drive,and I’ve tried,a used car,I can’t buy They’ve said I’ve got so much potential That I could be influential My effort’s remain inconsequential
Showered with praise that’s very superficial Ego stroking that’s artificial
Not a big fish now It’s unrelenting
Things always pending I’m still not winning There’s pity tempting In a quarter life crisis It’s void of meaning Just keep taking up space And underachieving Just keep taking up space and underachieving 
From jump I’ve strived to be the best
Burned bridges,bombed too many tests
Lots of paths I’ve walked,then laid to rest But grieved them all nonetheless 
Look up Terry Tao,wow,Billie Eilish in my feed now Studies show I’m far more likely to hang myself or bleed out
Get weeded out, lose steam,ow,get gunned down by a police crowd Done too much comparison and trying to make peace now somehow Anyhow,I don’t even know how,
Not allowed to sulk and simply think I’m just a stupid cow Ego stroking that’s artificial Not a big fish now It’s unrelenting Things always pending I’m still not winning There’s pity tempting In a quarter life crisis It’s void of meaning 
Just keep taking up space And underachieving Just keep taking up space and underachieving It’s unrelenting Things always pending I’m still not winning There’s pity tempting In a quarter life crisis It’s void of meaning Just keep taking up space And underachieving
Just keep taking up space and underachieving
